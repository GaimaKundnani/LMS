# Pustakalaya- Library Management System

A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application that libraries can use to 
manage their resources efficiently. It mainly includes the tracking of books, data on issuing 
and returning books, and maintaining book availability list. 

The primary objective of LMS is to organize and manage the resources of a library, making it 
easier for librarians to conduct everyday operations and create a user-friendly experience for 
users.
